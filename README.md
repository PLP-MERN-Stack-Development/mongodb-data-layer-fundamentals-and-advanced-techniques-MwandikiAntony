# MongoDB Fundamentals - Week 1 

This assignment demonstrates how to work with MongoDB by inserting sample Kenyan secondary school books and running various queries, including CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Install **MongoDB Community Server** and ensure it is running locally.
- Install **MongoDB Compass** (optional, GUI for exploring data).
- Install **Node.js** (for running the insert script).
- Install **mongosh** (MongoDB shell) if you want to run queries in the terminal.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Insert Books into the Database
This script uses Node.js to insert 10 sample Kenyan secondary school curriculum books.

```bash
node insert_books.js


The script connects to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017.

It inserts books into the library.books collection.

Output will confirm that books were inserted.

You can verify in MongoDB Compass:

Connect to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017.

Open the library database â†’ books collection.

You should see the inserted documents.

2. Run Queries

There are two ways to run the queries in queries.js:

a) Using MongoDB Compass

Open Compass.

Connect to your local MongoDB instance.

Go to library â†’ books.

Open Playground.

Copy queries from queries.js and run them.

b) Using mongosh

Open terminal and start mongosh:

mongosh


Switch to the database:

use library


Then copy-paste queries from queries.js.

ðŸ›  Tasks Covered
Task 2: Basic CRUD

Find books by genre, author, year.

Update book price.

Delete book by title.

Task 3: Advanced Queries

Find in-stock books published after 2010.

Projection (title, author, price only).

Sorting (ascending, descending).

Pagination (5 books per page).

Task 4: Aggregation Pipelines

Average price by genre.

Author with the most books.

Group by decade.

Task 5: Indexing

Index on title.

Compound index on author and published_year.

Use explain() to demonstrate performance.

âœ… Example Query

Find all novels:

db.books.find({ genre: "Novel" })


Find books after 2010:

db.books.find({ published_year: { $gt: 2010 } })
